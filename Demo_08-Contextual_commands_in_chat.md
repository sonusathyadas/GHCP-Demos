# Demo 08: Using Contextual commands in GitHub Copilot Chat

In GitHub Copilot Chat, `@workspace` and `@terminal` are contextual commands that help Copilot understand where to apply its responses. They specify the scope or location where Copilot should perform actions.

### Prerequisites
* VS Code 
* GitHub Copilot Chat Extension for VS Code
* NodeJS 18 or later
* GitHub Copilot subscription
* Book API project 

## Working with @workspace contextual command
1. Open the `book-api` project in VS Code.
2. Open the GitHub Copilot Chat and run the following prompt with the @workspace contextual command.

    ```
    @workspace where is the database connection string configured?
    ```

3. Below is the response generated by GitHub Copilot
